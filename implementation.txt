the plate will be used as the component to sense the existing of water. However, this sensor
was not very effective as it senses the water, the system will automatically ON the wiper at only one speed. The second
conceptual design is a two lines plate with a high and low line. The function of the low line plate is to detect the
showery rain. The high line plate is to detect the heavy rain. The third conceptual used the stamping concept. The
stamping sensor is a good sensor for sensing the moist, any kind of water or raindrops. Nevertheless the sensor is very
expensive. After considered all these criteria, second conceptual design was chosen to construct the circuit. The circuit
was changes from single relay to double relay as an input to PIC controller system
